In the Petra Excavation Trenches dataset I used context four and merged the files of redundant values.  only those with a clear misentry were edited such as "Trench 70"  vs "Trench 70 ".  others such as "Trench 69" vs "Trench 69?" were presumed deliberate and left alone.  
This was done in the interest of keeping the dataset cleaner to work with and quiery.

Again in the Petra Excavation trenches set I worked on the clustering of the Label column.  this was a  bit tricker as far more had both errors and question marks.  primarily taking out extra spaces and changing "(possibly)" to the more standard "(?)"  This was again done to make the data easier to quiery.
